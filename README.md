- Demo: Azure Portal & VS Code
- Lab: GitHub Codespaces

### Goal

- Build on the Agentic AI aspects
- Inspire and Motivate 
- Real world ideas for Agentic AI
- Focused on End-to-end building AI-powered applications
- Frictionless learning environment, learn via lab, demo and teaching moments
- Azure AI Protections
- GitHub Copilot Agent Model to accelerate development
- For some people without laptops or limited technical skills, allowing them to watch walkthroughs, whilst others do them

### Audience
- Technical teams
- Senior management like C-levels

### Labs

- Keep lab simple and able to be done end to end
- For experienced developers, share the accelerator repos and let them explore


Note: some of the labs will be adjusted based on the resources and licences available for the participants to use.
