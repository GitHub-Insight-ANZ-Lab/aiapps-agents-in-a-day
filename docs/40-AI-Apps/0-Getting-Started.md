- **Text Embedding**: Convert text to numerical vectors for similarity search

### Azure AI Services
- **Azure Translator**: Real-time text translation with 100+ languages
- **Azure Speech Services**: Text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities
- **Azure Computer Vision**: Image analysis, OCR, and object detection
- **Azure Content Safety**: Detect harmful content across text and images

### Integration Capabilities
- **Function Calling**: Connect AI models to external APIs and business systems
- **Multi-modal Processing**: Combine text, images, and audio in single workflows
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI responses for better user experience
- **Custom Models**: Fine-tune models for domain-specific use cases

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites Check

Ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 16+ )
node --version

# Check npm version
npm --version

# Verify VS Code installation
code --version
```

### Chatbot Application

The tutorials use a React-based chatbot application located in `apps-chat/chatbot/`. This provides the UI framework for implementing AI features.

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Navigate to the chatbot directory
cd apps-chat/chatbot

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with individual tutorial pages for each AI feature.

## Tutorial Navigation

### Beginner-Friendly Progression

The tutorials are designed to build upon each other:

1. **Start with Tutorial 1 (Design)** if you're new to AI APIs
2. **Focus on one tutorial at a time** to build understanding gradually
3. **Complete the implementation** before moving to the next tutorial
4. **Experiment with the advanced features** to deepen your knowledge

### Independent Learning

Each tutorial can also be completed independently if you have specific interests:

- **Visual AI** → Tutorials 1 (Design) and 3 (Vision)
- **Language AI** → Tutorials 2 (Translation) and 5 (SEO)
- **Conversational AI** → Tutorials 4 (Speech) and 6 (Automation)

## Tips for Success

### 1. Select the Right Model

Different tutorials use different AI models:
- **GPT-4o** for text and vision tasks
- **DALL-E 3** for image generation
- **Azure Speech Services** for text-to-speech

Always select the appropriate model in the Configuration section before testing.

### 2. Clear Chat Sessions

Each tutorial involves different prompts and contexts. Click "Clear Chat" between different tutorial exercises to ensure clean results.

### 3. Copy-Paste Code Snippets

Tutorial code is provided in copy-friendly format. Click the copy icon in code blocks to quickly transfer code to your development environment.

```typescript
// Example: This code block has a copy button
async function exampleFunction() {
    console.log("Ready to start building AI apps!");
}
```

### 4. Incremental Development

- **Test each function** as you implement it
- **Use console.log** to debug API responses
- **Start simple** and add complexity gradually

## Building Production-Ready AI Applications

### Security Best Practices
```typescript
// Example: Secure API key management
const getAzureOpenAIClient = () => {
    const endpoint = process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT;
    const apiKey = process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY;
    
    if (!endpoint || !apiKey) {
        throw new Error('Missing required Azure OpenAI configuration');
    }
    
    return new OpenAIClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));
};
```

### Error Handling and Resilience
```typescript
// Example: Robust error handling with retry logic
async function callAIServiceWithRetry(serviceCall: () => Promise<any>, maxRetries = 3) {
    for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
        try {
            return await serviceCall();
        } catch (error) {
            if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
            
            const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
        }
    }
}
```

### Cost Optimization
- **Caching**: Store and reuse AI responses when appropriate
- **Request Batching**: Group multiple operations for efficiency
- **Model Selection**: Choose the right model for each task's complexity
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent unexpected cost spikes from high usage

### Monitoring and Analytics
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and success rates
- **Usage Analytics**: Monitor token consumption and API calls
- **Quality Metrics**: Measure AI output quality and user satisfaction
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor spending across different AI services
