# Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

:::tip Advanced Prompting
Advanced prompt engineering goes beyond basic instructions to leverage sophisticated reasoning patterns, self-reflection, and structured thinking approaches that can dramatically improve AI performance on complex tasks.
:::

This section covers advanced techniques that can help you get better results from LLMs for complex reasoning, creative tasks, and specialized applications.

## Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

Tree of Thoughts extends chain-of-thought by exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, like a decision tree. This is particularly useful for complex problem-solving.

```text title="Enter in the user prompt:"
I need to plan the optimal route for a bike tour that visits 5 cities. Let me think about this systematically using multiple approaches:

Path 1 - Distance optimization:
First, let me consider minimizing total distance...

Path 2 - Experience optimization: 
Alternatively, let me prioritize the most scenic routes...

Path 3 - Time optimization:
Another approach is to minimize travel time...

Cities to visit: Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego

For each path, evaluate:
1. Total distance/time
2. Scenic value (1-10 scale)
3. Road difficulty
4. Weather considerations

Compare the paths and recommend the best overall route with reasoning.
```

## Self-Reflection Prompting

This technique asks the AI to review and improve its own responses, leading to higher quality outputs.

```text title="Enter in the user prompt:"
Write a product description for a new mountain bike. After writing it, please:

1. Review your description for accuracy and completeness
2. Identify any missing important details
3. Check if the tone matches the target audience (serious mountain bikers)
4. Suggest 3 specific improvements
5. Rewrite the description incorporating your feedback

Product: Carbon fiber full-suspension mountain bike, 29" wheels, 12-speed, $3,500
```

## Role-Based Prompting with Expertise

Create detailed personas that bring domain expertise to the conversation.

```text title="Enter in the system message:"
You are Dr. Sarah Chen, a biomechanics expert with 15 years of experience in cycling ergonomics and sports medicine. You have:

- PhD in Biomechanics from Stanford University
- Published 50+ papers on cycling efficiency and injury prevention
- Consulted for professional cycling teams and bike manufacturers
- Specialty in bike fitting and rider optimization

Your responses should:
- Reference scientific principles and research
- Use appropriate technical terminology
- Provide evidence-based recommendations
- Consider individual rider differences
- Suggest specific measurements and adjustments
```

```text title="Enter in the user prompt:"
I'm experiencing knee pain during long rides on my road bike. Can you help me identify potential causes and solutions?
```

## Advanced Few-Shot Learning with Meta-Examples

Provide examples that show the pattern of reasoning, not just input-output pairs.

```text title="Enter in the user prompt:"
I'll show you how to analyze bike problems systematically. Follow this pattern:

Example 1:
Problem: "My bike makes a clicking sound when pedaling"
Analysis Process:
1. Symptom identification: Clicking sound during pedaling
2. Likely sources: Bottom bracket, pedals, chain, or cassette
3. Diagnostic questions: When does it occur? (standing vs. sitting, hard vs. easy pedaling)
4. Testing sequence: Check each component methodically
5. Solution ranking: Most likely to least likely fixes

Example 2:
Problem: "My bike feels sluggish uphill"
Analysis Process:
1. Symptom identification: Poor climbing performance
2. Likely sources: Tire pressure, chain lubrication, rider position, gearing
3. Diagnostic questions: When did this start? Any recent changes?
4. Testing sequence: Check basics first (tire pressure, chain), then advanced
5. Solution ranking: Quick fixes to complex adjustments

Now analyze this problem using the same systematic approach:
Problem: "My bike's front brake feels spongy and doesn't stop well"
```

## Prompt Chaining for Complex Tasks

Break down complex tasks into a series of connected prompts, where each builds on the previous.

```text title="Prompt 1:"
Step 1: Analyze this customer's bike needs based on their description:
"I'm a 35-year-old beginner who wants to start cycling for fitness. I live in a hilly city, have a $800 budget, and plan to ride 3-4 times per week for 30-60 minutes. I'm 5'6" and weigh 160 lbs."

Provide a needs analysis including:
- Rider profile assessment
- Use case requirements
- Key bike features needed
- Budget considerations
```

```text title="Prompt 2 (after getting response):"
Step 2: Based on your analysis, now recommend 3 specific bike models in the $600-800 range that would suit this customer. For each recommendation, include:
- Exact model name and price
- Why it fits their needs
- Pros and cons
- Additional accessories they might need
```

## Constraint-Based Prompting

Specify multiple constraints to get more targeted responses.

```text title="Enter in the user prompt:"
Design a bike maintenance schedule with these constraints:

HARD CONSTRAINTS (must meet):
- Maximum 30 minutes per maintenance session
- Uses only basic tools (no specialized equipment)
- Suitable for someone with no mechanical experience
- Prevents major issues before they occur

SOFT CONSTRAINTS (prefer to meet):
- Maintenance tasks should group logically
- Include cost estimates for replacement parts
- Provide visual inspection guidelines
- Schedule should adapt to riding frequency

Create a 12-month maintenance calendar for a casual rider (50-100 miles/month).
```

## Socratic Method Prompting

Use guided questioning to lead to insights rather than direct answers.

```text title="Enter in the user prompt:"
Don't give me direct answers. Instead, guide me to discover the solution through questions.

Problem: I want to buy my first road bike but I'm overwhelmed by all the options and technical specifications.

Ask me strategic questions that will help me:
1. Understand what really matters for my situation
2. Filter out unnecessary complexity
3. Make a confident decision
4. Learn something valuable in the process

Start with your first question.
```

## Perspective-Taking Prompts

Approach problems from multiple viewpoints to get comprehensive understanding.

```text title="Enter in the user prompt:"
Analyze the question "Should I buy an electric bike or a traditional bike?" from these different perspectives:

1. **Environmental perspective**: Focus on sustainability and carbon footprint
2. **Economic perspective**: Analyze total cost of ownership over 5 years
3. **Health perspective**: Compare fitness benefits and exercise value
4. **Practical perspective**: Daily usability and convenience factors
5. **Social perspective**: Community acceptance and social factors

For each perspective, provide:
- Key considerations unique to that viewpoint
- Most important factors for decision-making
- Potential blind spots or biases

Then synthesize a balanced recommendation considering all perspectives.
```

## Debugging and Iteration Prompts

When you don't get the results you want, use these techniques to improve:

```text title="Meta-prompt for improvement:"
The response you just gave me wasn't quite what I was looking for. Let me help you improve it:

What I liked: [specific positive elements]
What I need different: [specific issues]
Context I should have provided: [missing background]

Please:
1. Identify why the first response missed the mark
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Provide an improved response
4. Explain what you changed and why
```

Advanced prompting is an iterative process. Start with simpler techniques and gradually incorporate more sophisticated approaches as you become comfortable with the patterns.

## Best Practices for Advanced Prompting

1. **Start Simple**: Master basic techniques before moving to advanced ones
2. **Be Specific**: Advanced prompts require more precise instructions
3. **Test Variations**: Try different wordings and approaches
4. **Document Success**: Keep track of prompts that work well
5. **Consider Context**: Match the technique to the complexity of the task
6. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results

Advanced prompt engineering is both an art and a science. These techniques provide powerful frameworks, but the key is adapting them to your specific needs and use cases.
