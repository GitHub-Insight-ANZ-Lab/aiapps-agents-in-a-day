  - Comprehensive tool collection for PSR tournament functionality
  - Multiple specialized tools: question answering, move analysis, validation, performance analysis
  - Error handling and validation for tool usage
  - State management across tool interactions
  - Detailed tool result reporting with confidence scores

### V3 - Agentic RAG (Lesson 55: Agentic RAG)
- **File**: `agent_v3_agentic_rag.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - Autonomous Retrieval-Augmented Generation with iterative query refinement
  - Self-correction mechanisms and confidence evaluation
  - Comprehensive knowledge base with vector search simulation
  - Memory and state management across retrieval loops
  - Dynamic query refinement based on confidence thresholds

### V4 - Multi-Agent Coordination (Lesson 58: Multi-Agent Design Patterns)
- **File**: `agent_v4_multi_agent.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - Specialized agents for different tournament functions
  - Inter-agent communication via message bus
  - Distributed task handling and collaborative decision making
  - Performance monitoring and visibility into multi-agent interactions
  - Centralized coordination with autonomous agent specialization

### V5 - Agentic Protocols (Lesson 61: Agentic Protocols)
- **File**: `agent_v5_agentic_protocols.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for tool discovery and execution
  - Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for distributed agent collaboration
  - Protocol-aware communication with standardized interfaces
  - Dynamic capability discovery and interoperability
  - Comprehensive artifact and event management

## Usage Examples

Each agent version can be tested independently:

```bash
# Test individual agents
python agent_v1_semantic_kernel.py
python agent_v2_tool_use.py
python agent_v3_agentic_rag.py
python agent_v4_multi_agent.py
python agent_v5_agentic_protocols.py
```

Or used in the actual tournament by modifying the main `app.py` to import the desired version.

## Integration with Tournament Server

All agent versions are compatible with the PSR tournament server API and can:
- Register as tournament players
- Receive questions and submit answers
- Make Rock/Paper/Scissors move selections  
- Track tournament results and performance
- Provide autonomous gameplay with varying levels of sophistication

## Educational Value

Each version demonstrates increasingly sophisticated AI agent concepts:

1. **V1**: Foundation of agent frameworks and modular design
2. **V2**: Tool-based architecture and function calling patterns  
3. **V3**: Autonomous reasoning and iterative improvement
4. **V4**: Collaborative multi-agent systems and coordination
5. **V5**: Standardized protocols and interoperability

The progression shows how AI agents can evolve from simple automated players to sophisticated, protocol-aware systems capable of complex reasoning and collaboration.
